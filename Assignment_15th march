Q1: Explain the following with an example:

    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of a machine to mimic human intelligence. An example of AI is a chatbot that can hold a conversation with a human.
    Machine Learning (ML) is a type of AI that allows machines to learn without being explicitly programmed. An example of ML is a spam filter that learns to identify spam emails.
    Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML that uses artificial neural networks to learn. An example of DL is a facial recognition system that can identify people from their faces.

Q2: What is supervised learning? List some examples of supervised learning.

Supervised learning is a type of ML where the machine is given labeled data. The machine then learns to associate the labels with the data. Some examples of supervised learning are:

    Classification: The machine learns to classify data into different categories. For example, a machine could learn to classify images of animals into different species.
    Regression: The machine learns to predict a continuous value from the data. For example, a machine could learn to predict the price of a house based on its features.

Q3: What is unsupervised learning? List some examples of unsupervised learning.

Unsupervised learning is a type of ML where the machine is not given labeled data. The machine then learns to find patterns in the data. Some examples of unsupervised learning are:

    Clustering: The machine learns to group data points together based on their similarities. For example, a machine could learn to group customers together based on their buying habits.
    Dimensionality reduction: The machine learns to reduce the number of dimensions in the data. This can make the data easier to visualize and analyze.

Q4: What is the difference between AI, ML, DL, and DS?

    AI is the umbrella term that encompasses all of the other terms.
    ML is a subset of AI that allows machines to learn without being explicitly programmed.
    DL is a subset of ML that uses artificial neural networks to learn.
    DS is the field of study that deals with the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data.

Q5: What are the main differences between supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning?

The main difference between supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning is the amount of labeled data that is available.

    Supervised learning requires labeled data. This means that the machine is given the correct output for each input.
    Unsupervised learning does not require labeled data. The machine learns to find patterns in the data without any guidance.
    Semi-supervised learning uses a combination of labeled and unlabeled data. This allows the machine to learn more quickly than if it was only using unlabeled data.

Q6: What is train, test and validation split? Explain the importance of each term.

Train, test, and validation split is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model. The data is split into three sets: the train set, the test set, and the validation set.

    The train set is used to train the model.
    The test set is used to test the model after it has been trained.
    The validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters of the model.

It is important to use a train, test, and validation split because it allows you to evaluate the performance of your model on unseen data. This gives you a more accurate estimate of how well your model will perform in the real world.

Q7: How can unsupervised learning be used in anomaly detection?

Unsupervised learning can be used to detect anomalies in data. This is because anomalies are often outliers that do not fit the patterns of the normal data.

For example, you could use unsupervised learning to detect credit card fraud. You would train a model on a dataset of normal credit card transactions. Then, you could use the model to identify transactions that are outliers. These transactions would be flagged as potential fraud.
